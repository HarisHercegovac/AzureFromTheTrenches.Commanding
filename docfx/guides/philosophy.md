# Philosophy - Why Develop this Framework?

I began work on the framework when I found myself facing some challenging constraints on projects including:

* Limited budgets.
* Very small teams.
* High expectations.
* Emerging requirements while searching for market fit.
* The need to address scale - not on launch day but in the comparatively near future.

Essentially I knew I would be heading towards a micro-service architecture but wouldn't be able to pay the [micro-service tax](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MicroservicePremium.html) until the product was established.

Given that operations in a distributed system are essentially expressed as state - messages - then adopting that approach for in-process operations seemed to be a good starting point if I wanted to allow myself to move fairly easily from something more monolithic into something decomposed.

That led me to the idea of starting with a modular monolith with clear bounded contexts and many of the sub-systems hosted in shared process spaces that I would later be able to decompose into isolated components communicating with events, brokered messages and REST APIs.

I wanted to be able to construct this modular monolith in C# in a way that would be well supported by tooling and maximise productivity early on. At the same time I wanted to be able to decompose it without changing any business logic and with as little code change as possible. To achieve that I settled on a configuration based approach making use of a commanding pattern with operations expressed as state and dispatched via a mediator.

I looked at the popular [Mediatr](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) framework however given my own goals I was concerned that it did not pull apart dispatch and execution. This was something I felt that ought to be masked by the mediator when executing commands but ought to be exposed in a way that would allow for extension. With hindsight I'm not sure how much of this was luck or genuine forward thinking on my part but it was a realisation that proved to be key when I wanted to execute commands over HTTP connections and dispatch them to queues.

All that being the case I began work on this framework. Of course I didn't get all this implemented in version 1 - it's rather been a process of steadily learning and evolving the framework based on experience and feedback. If you look back at my initial commits things changed massively to begin with as I worked through concepts and ideas. Lots of things have been added and changed and a few ideas dropped but the core has been stable for a while now and recent work has been about adding additional extensions, smoothing out the developer experience, and reducing boilerplate.
